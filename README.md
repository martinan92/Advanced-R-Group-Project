Welcome to our advanced R project working on a marketing campaign data set focussing on term deposit offers! This project focuses on the classification problem that a Portugese bank was facing, which can be found under following [link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing#). The bank wanted to know which customers are more likely to accept a term deposit offer in a telemarketing campaign. Thus a predicitive model to answer this question is created in order to optimize the bank's marketing resources. The general idea behind this is that it is preferrable to call customers that are more likely to accept the offer because each call means marketing cost and with such a predicitive model not only cost can be controlled better but also the actual return on the marketing campaign can be improved.

Our worked is divided into two parts: Data exploration and modelling (including feature engineering). Thus two markdowns are provided to give a better overview.

But before we go into the project itself, lets introduce our team tackled this problem by dividing the machine learning process into three different workstreams:

Data exploration and visualization: Christine, Victor, Celine -- Data engineering: Tomas, Theo -- Modelling - Dan, Andrew
